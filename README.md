# Public Documentation of my Crypto Trading System
While the code is kept in a private repository, I have decided to outline my ongoing system design for trading cryptocurrencies (spot and perpetual) across a variety of centralized and decentralized exchanges. The base system is written in C++ leveraging Boost and Websocketpp with some less-pertinent components written in python. Herein, I'll outline the design structure as well as on-going notes I find while integrating with exchanges.
